Introduction
============

Ploneboard is an easy to use web board. It uses the proven Plone user
interface, and is made for easy integration into Plone sites. The target
audience is businesses and developers wanting a discussion board in their
Plone site.

Ploneboard aims to do one thing, and do it well. It will never be an
over-the-top all-bells-and-whistles message board, but will stay minimal in the
sense that it's living inside an existing content management system - and will
leverage that to the fullest extent possible.
