Ploneboard requires:

* SimpleAttachment_


.. _SimpleAttachment: http://plone.org/products/simpleattachment

Installation
============

See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed product installation instructions.

.. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products/installing



Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Ploneboard
is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
instance::

  [instance]
  eggs = Products.Ploneboard


If another egg package depends on Products.Ploneboard you do not need
to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
automatically.

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
will take care of updating your system.

.. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

Installing without buildout
---------------------------

You can install Ploneboard easily using the easy_install command from
setuptools; this will install both Ploneboard and SimpleAttachment. You can
install this in either the system python path or in the lib/python directory
of your Zope instance. If you have setuptools installed you can do this
using easy_install::

  easy_install Products.Ploneboard

If you do not have setuptools you can install both manually by using the
setup.py script in the SimpleAttachment and Ploneboard sources. If you want
to install SimpleAttachment inside your Zope instance instead of system wide
you can its ''--prefix='' option to install in the ''lib/python'' directory
of your Zope instance.
